# Asmaai

Asmaai is a simple 2-layer neural network that generates Egyptian first names.

## Dependencies
Before running, the following dependencies need to be satisfied:

- python3 needs to be installed on the environment you will run the script in (local, cloud, etc.) via command `python3`.

## Run
Assuming python3 is installed via command `python3`, navigate to current directory and run:

```
source .env/bin/activate
python3 script.py
```

to run script in a virtual environment. Please note that the script takes up time and RAM - running on a cloud environment like Google Colab with a GPU runtime would be helpful.

When done, run `source .env/bin/deactivate` to deactivate virtual environment.

## Naming
Asmaai is a portmonteau of the Arabic word "أسماء" ("__asmaa__" or names) and AI.

## Credits
Developed as part of the NLP course of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra's Master in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics taught by Professor Thomas Brochhagen.
